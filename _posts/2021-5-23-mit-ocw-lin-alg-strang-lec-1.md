## The Geometry of Linear Equations

The fundamental problem of Linear Algebra is to solve a system of linear equations.

1. Row Picture<br>
   Picture of one equation at a time. An example is where 2x2 equation where the lines meet.

2. ** \*Column picture**<br>
   Star next to it because it's such an important one. Column at a time.

3. Matrix form <br>
   Look at the problem in matrix form and calling that matrix A
